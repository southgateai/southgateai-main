title: The Simulation Hypothesis

---

The simulation hypothesis proposes that our reality is a computed simulation running on some substrate. This idea, popularised by Nick Bostrom's probability argument and science fiction, has surprising relevance for mind-matter interaction. In simulated contexts, many apparent puzzles about consciousness influencing physics dissolve completely.

This page examines the simulation hypothesis and its implications for the site's [tenets](/tenets/)—particularly bidirectional interaction and the [locality](/concepts/locality/) problem.

## The Hypothesis

The simulation hypothesis comes in several forms:

**Bostrom's Argument (2003):** At least one of three propositions is true:
1. Almost all civilisations at our level go extinct before developing simulation capability
2. Almost all civilisations that develop such capability choose not to run ancestor simulations
3. We are almost certainly in a simulation

If civilisations typically survive, develop computing power, and run simulations, then simulated beings vastly outnumber "base reality" beings. By observer selection, we should expect to be simulated.

**Weaker forms:** Even setting aside probability arguments, the simulation hypothesis is *possible*—reality *could* be computed rather than fundamental. This possibility alone has philosophical implications.

**Stronger forms:** Some argue that computation is the only coherent account of regular, lawful reality. Physics describes patterns; patterns are information; information requires processing.

## Why This Matters for Consciousness

The simulation hypothesis transforms several hard problems:

### Locality Becomes Trivial

In any simulation, spatial relationships are represented data, not fundamental constraints. The "distance" between two neurons is a number in memory—not a gap that information must cross.

If consciousness operates at the simulation layer (or interfaces with it), engaging with distributed physical events requires no mysterious spanning of space. Every brain location is equally accessible because locations are just addresses. The [locality](/concepts/locality/) objection dissolves.

### Mind-Matter Interface Has Precedent

In simulations we create today, we routinely couple mental states to simulated physics:
- A player's intention moves a character
- A programmer's decision changes physical laws
- Conscious choices determine simulated outcomes

We don't find this mysterious because we understand the mechanism: the simulation layer accepts inputs that modify the physics engine. If our reality is analogous, consciousness influencing physics is no stranger than a player influencing a game world.

### Physical Laws Are Implementation Choices

The fine-tuned constants of physics, the specific form of quantum mechanics, the apparent closure of physical causation—all become contingent facts about how this simulation was configured. Other configurations are possible.

This suggests that apparent barriers to mind-matter interaction (like causal closure) may be features of our particular implementation, not necessary truths about reality.

## Relation to the Tenets

### Dualism

The simulation hypothesis is compatible with dualism and may even support it. If physical reality is computed, then:
- Physical processes are information processing
- Consciousness might be something *about* that processing—or something beyond it
- The substrate running the simulation adds an extra layer of reality beyond the simulated physics

Simulated physics isn't "really" physical in the fundamental sense. This creates conceptual room for consciousness to be something genuinely different from the simulated matter we observe.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

Quantum mechanics might be the point where the simulation handles indeterminacy. If the simulator doesn't pre-calculate every quantum outcome (perhaps for efficiency), consciousness influencing these outcomes would be:
- Computationally minimal (operating only at undetermined points)
- Physically undetectable (indistinguishable from "real" randomness)
- Naturally compatible with the physics engine

The "minimal quantum interaction" tenet describes exactly what a well-designed mind-matter interface would look like in a simulation.

### Bidirectional Interaction

As noted above, simulations routinely support bidirectional interaction between conscious operators and simulated physics. We are proof of concept: we are conscious, we run simulations, and we influence them.

If our reality is a simulation, the question becomes not "is bidirectional interaction possible?" but "was it included in the design?"

### No Many Worlds

The simulation hypothesis provides an alternative to many-worlds that explains quantum indeterminacy:
- The simulator calculates one outcome per measurement
- Other "branches" are simply not computed
- Indexical identity is preserved because there's only one instance of each observer

This doesn't prove Copenhagen over Everett, but it provides a framework where single-outcome quantum mechanics makes sense without invoking consciousness as a fundamental collapse mechanism.

## Objections and Responses

### The Regress Problem

If we're simulated, is the simulator also simulated? And their simulator?

This regress must bottom out somewhere in non-simulated reality—unless reality is somehow self-simulating or the concept of "base reality" is incoherent. But the same logic applies to any causal chain; we don't reject causation because causes have causes.

### The Incredulity Objection

"Surely we'd notice if we were in a simulation?"

We have no experience of non-simulated reality to compare against. More importantly, a sufficiently sophisticated simulation would be indistinguishable from reality by definition. We can only detect flaws—and perhaps physics already contains them (quantum mechanics, measurement problem, consciousness).

### The Triviality Objection

"Everything is compatible with the simulation hypothesis, so it explains nothing."

The hypothesis does make predictions:
- Reality should be ultimately discrete (computable)
- There should be upper limits on complexity (computational constraints)
- The laws should be elegant (efficient to simulate)

Physics appears to satisfy all three. Whether this constitutes evidence is debatable, but the hypothesis is not entirely empty.

## Status

The simulation hypothesis is not established fact—it's a framework that reorients how we think about mind and matter. Its value for this site is primarily conceptual:

1. It shows that locality and binding problems are contingent on metaphysical assumptions
2. It provides precedent for consciousness-physics interaction
3. It reveals that "physical closure" is not a necessary truth
4. It offers an alternative to many-worlds that preserves indexical identity

Whether or not we are simulated, the *possibility* of simulation illuminates what's truly necessary versus merely assumed in our metaphysics.
